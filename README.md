React Comments app

backend port ~ 8000

You can:
Create, Edit, Delete, Reply a comment

TECHNOLOGIES:
TypeScript, Redux, Redux-Thunk + Axios, SASS

PROBLEMS:
Tried to connect the functionalities of Updating and Deleting a reply, but it's not working. I'm guessing due to the server (wrong type of parameters or something else).

TIME
I've spend 9h-9.5h 
30m setting up the project
45m figuring out the logic of app
3h-3.5h trying to connect functionalities of Updating and Deleting a reply
The most time was spent for testing the requests, defining appropriate parameters and its types
